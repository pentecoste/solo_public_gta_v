# solo_public_gta_v
Simple python script that purposely suspends GTAV.exe, causing the player to be alone in a public session. Useful because on invite-only or private sessions not all game interactions are available and some of them are easier to do if nobody can interfere with your plans..

# install
Just install psutil via pip and you'll be ready to go

# run
python buggaSessione.py

Only works on Windows. Tested with Python 3.8, 3.10 and 3.11, but any other Python3 version should be fine.
